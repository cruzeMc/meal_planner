	Assignment 1





Assumptions:
- One owner owns one kitchen

Constraints (unable to show on ER diagram):
- 1 meal plan can be generated a week
- One ordinary user can have one meal advisor, and one meal advisor can advise one ordinary user.

Added Information:
- Expiry date for ingredients in a userâ€™s kitchen, to allow a user to know if his/her stock of ingredients is about to expire or is expired.
- A meal advisor entity, which is a user. This would be helpful to users who have little nutritional and meal planning knowledge and would like assistance in planning meals which are right for them.
